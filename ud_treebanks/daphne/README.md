# Daphne Trees

## Source

The data was converted from the latest [Daphne](https://perseids-publications.github.io/daphne-trees/) 
release.

[Daphne](https://perseids-publications.github.io/daphne-trees/) collects treebanks of 
Greek poetry annotated by Francesco Mambrini. Most files are based on the version 
previously published in the [AGLDT](https://perseusdl.github.io/treebank_data/), with 
some modifications.

Note that, thogh no systematic re-editing of the text 
was undertaken, the annotated texts of the Greek tragedies might differ from the digital 
editions published in the Perseus Project. Daphne modified editions are collected 
[here](https://github.com/francescomambrini/Daphne/tree/master/data/texts).

## Attribution

All the annotations are by F. Mambrni.

The *Ajax* of Sophocles is based on the annotation of D. Libatique published in the 
AGLDT, but with systematic and comprehensive revision by F. Mambrini.
