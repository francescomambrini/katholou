# AGDT

AGDT is the informal name of the Greek section of the 
[Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebank](https://perseusdl.github.io/treebank_data/) 
published by the Perseus Project.

In this folder, you'll find the converted works that are not part of the original 
distributions of [Daphne]() and [Gorman Trees]().

This basically means:
* Homer's *Iliad* and *Odyssey*
* Hesiod's works (coming soon!)
* *Hymn to Demeter* (coming soon!)

## Distribution

Due to their size, Homer's works have been split in 4 files, each with a sequence of 6 books.
