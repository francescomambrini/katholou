# AGDT

## Source

AGDT is the informal name of the Greek section of the 
[Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebank](https://perseusdl.github.io/treebank_data/) 
published by the Perseus Project.

In this folder, you'll find the converted works that are not part of the original 
distributions of [Daphne]() and [Gorman Trees]().

This basically means:
* Homer's *Iliad* and *Odyssey*
* *Hymn to Demeter*
* Hesiod's works (coming soon!)

## Distribution

Due to their size, *Iliad* and *Odyssey* works have been split in 4 files, each with a sequence of 6 books.

## Attribution

The AGLDT is edited by Giuseppe Celano and David Bamman (editor emeritus), with the supervision 
of Gregory R. Crane and Bridget Almas. 

The converted files are based on the work of the following annotators: Jennifer Adams, Jennifer Curtin, James C. D'Amico, W. B. Dolan, Calliopi Dourou, Scott J. Dube, C. Dan Earley, Mary Ebbott, J. F. Gentile, Francis Hartel, Jordan Hawkesworth, Connor Hayden, Tovah Keynton, Michael Kinney, Florin Leonte, Alex Lessie, Daniel Lim Libatique, Brian Livingston, Meg Luthin, George Matthews, Molly Miller, Jack Mitchell, Jessica Nord, Anthony D.
